# Blender Frame Range Selector Addon
This addon for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) adds the ability to set the frame range to the start and end frame of a selected strip in the [sequencer](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/video_editing/sequencer/introduction.html).

## Installation

TODO

## Use

A `Set Frame Range` button is added to the `Strip` pannel in the tool menu in the `Sequencer` editor workspace. Clicking it will set the scene's `Start Frame` and `End Frame` to be same as the selected strip.
